# Summary

- Hi, I’m @radcli14, an aerospace and mechanical engineer, specialized in dynamics (physics of motion)  
- I’m interested in mobile application development and 3D graphics
- I am skilled in writing data analysis and simulation code in MATLAB and Python
- I have released several applications on the App Store and Google Play, and am familiar in native Swift and Kotlin programming
- I’m currently learning Unity and C#

# Projects 

## Mobile Multibody Dynamics
"MOMDYN" is a long term personal project of mine, and is the first ever multibody dynamics app on mobile devices.
My vision is that this app, and other concepts I'm considering, fill an un-tapped market for useful engineering applications that students and professionals can access while on-the-go, whenever their creativity strikes.
Originally created in pure Python, using the Kivy framework, I have since ported to native code using Python for the scientific back-end.
Notably, combining Python and Swift is a major challenge, and in the process I developed the Bee Swift repository, which I believe to be the only existing clear procedure that explains how to combine Python and SwiftUI.
MOMDYN is currently available on both the App Store and Google Play.
