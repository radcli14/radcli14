# Summary

- Hi, I’m @radcli14, an aerospace and mechanical engineer, specialized in dynamics (physics of motion)  
- I’m interested in mobile application development and 3D graphics
- I am skilled in writing data analysis and simulation code in MATLAB and Python
- I have released several applications on the App Store and Google Play, and am familiar in native Swift and Kotlin programming
- I’m currently learning Unity and C#

# Projects 

## Mobile Multibody Dynamics
"MOMDYN" is a long term personal project of mine, and is the first ever multibody dynamics app on mobile devices.
My vision is that this app, and other concepts I'm considering, fill an un-tapped market for useful engineering applications that students and professionals can access while on-the-go, whenever their creativity strikes.
Originally created in pure Python, using the Kivy framework, I have since ported to native code using Python for the scientific back-end.
Notably, combining Python and Swift is a major challenge, and in the process I developed the Bee Swift repository, which I believe to be the only existing clear procedure that explains how to combine Python and SwiftUI.
MOMDYN is currently available on both the App Store and Google Play.

## Real-Time Simulation in Unity for Scientists and Engineers
In fall of 2022 I took an 8 week course in Unity that is offered by my workplace.
As we are aerospace engineers (not game developers), the course focused on the attributes of the Unity engine that are useful to the hard sciences.
In particular, an emphasis was placed on scripting and the C# programming language.
My own interest was in evaluating the built-in physics engine, with focus on its capacity to accurately simulate dynamics.
Unfortunately, I came away with the impression that the physics engine only "looks" real, its not viable as an engineering tool on its own.
However, I did gain experience in writing my own, accurate simulation models in the C# language, and rendering them in 3D.
I have since applied the knowledge gained in my professional job, creating lifelike visualizations of rocket launches using kinematic states estimated from accelerometers.
